Ideally, you should be familiar with the concepts covered in the [Building a Bicycle Route Tracker in eZ Platform tutorial](https://doc.ez.no/display/DEVELOPER/Building+a+Bicycle+Route+Tracker+in+eZ+Platform).

# Upgrading from Landing Page to Page Builder

In eZ Platform 2.2, the Landing Page was replaced with Page Builder. When upgrading to eZ Platform 2.2, Landing page layouts and blocks will need to be migrated to the new Page builder.
In this repo, there is a branch named `upgraded_to_2.2`, where the source code for sidebar layout and the Random block is updated to be compatible with the new Page Builder.
